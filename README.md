# CISC3130-Lab7: Portfolio Website
## Create a portfolio website.

---
### About
---
This is the final Lab for CISC3130 course.  
A simple portfolio website that has few sections, executed using only HTML and CSS for the most part.

---
### Dependencies
---
- Terminal for command line access

There are no packages needs to be installed to run the contents of this repo, since this is a very simple webpage that runs purely on HTML+CSS+JS.

---
### Setup and Usage
---
1. While you are in the home directory of this repo, press on the green "Code" button in the top right corner.
2. You will be prompted to copy an SSH or HTTPS URL to clone this repo to your local machine(I personally prefer to clone over SSH, because it's more secure).
3. After you got that URL, go to the terminal on your local machine and run the following command: 
```zsh
git clone *PASTE THE LINK HERE*
```
4. It should not tale long to copy all the files to your computer, since this is a very lightweight repo, so after it's done cd to the newly created folder by running: 
```zsh 
cd CISC3130-Lab7
```  
5. When you are inside of the CISC3130-Lab6 directory, run the following command: 
```zsh
open index.html
```
That's it, after that you will be presented with my portfolio page.
